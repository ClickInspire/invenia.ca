				<p>With a background in Bioinformatics and Human Computer Interactions, Rory Finnegan joined Invenia as a Linux power user and renaissance dev. When not learning some new piece of software for work, Rory is biking around Winnipeg, reading classic sci-fi, or growing a beard large enough to carry his cat (Wookie) in.</p>
