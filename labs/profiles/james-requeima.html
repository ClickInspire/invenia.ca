                I’m a researcher at Invenia Technical Computing based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, . We use machine learning techniques to forecast demand for power in the electricity grid, energy production from wind farms, and electricity prices in wholesale power markets. I'm currently in a research office in Cambridge, UK, where I live.
                
                I’m also a tenured member of the Department of Mathematics at Dawson College in Montreal, Quebec. If you're looking for CEGEP-level materials and online resources, my colleagues and I maintain this website.
                
                Here is my Curriculum Vitae
                
                As a student, my specialization was geometric group theory, combinatorial group theory, and algebraic topology. I studied under Dani Wise at McGill University, who was recently awarded the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry.
                
                My thesis was titled: “Relative Sectional Curvature in Compact Angled 2-complexes”.
                Here is my master’s thesis. At Invenia he works on our machine learning and risk management programs. In his spare time he is a bike enthusiast, photographer and musician.
                
                I also enjoy studying machine learning. Here is a small summary that I wrote about L0, L1, and L2 regularization.
                
                I enjoy travelling and taking photographs. So far, I have been to Iceland, England, Portugal, Greece, Cuba, China, Japan, Korea, Cambodia, Thailand and India. You can read about some of my travelling adventures here or check out some photos here.
