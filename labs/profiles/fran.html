				<p>Francesco's research focuses on statistical physics and complex systems, in particular complex networks, econophysics and agent-based modelling. More recently he got interested into memristive devices and computation of memristive networks. He has several collaboration across the globe, between London, Boston, San Diego, Canada, Berlin and Sydney.<br>
                
                He is a theoretical physicist, interested in quantum and classical systems and the application of techniques of statistical physics and complexity to other disciplines such as economics and engineering.<br>
                His PhD was in condensed matter models for quantum gravity, involving work in statistical physics of dynamical graphs models, renormalization group and black holes, but more recently he has  been involved in complex systems research, complex networks and agent-based models.<br><br>
                
                He is currently a Senior Researcher at Invenia Lab, a honorary member in the Computer Science Department at University College London and a visitor of the London Institute for Mathematical Sciences, but living in Berlin.<br><br>
