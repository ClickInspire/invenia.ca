            <h2>Optimal dynamical leverage with market impact</h2>
            <p>Caravelli, Sindoni, Caccioli, Ududec</p>
			<p>


            <p> Abstract: <it>When dealing with financial instruments which are modelled by some geometric Brownian motion it is important to consider time-average growth rates (or use something like a log-utility function, or the closely related Kelly criterion) when evaluating decisions, rather than simple expectations or ensemble averages at a single time.
                In the case of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process this is simplified by the independence of the expectation value at some time from the past history of the process. This feature is lost in the presence of a time-dependent drift term, and thus a more careful analysis is required.
                In this paper we study the optimal leverage in the case of specific functional forms which take into account the effect of market impact.  This is closer to realistic processes involved in financial markets, in particular when considering trades on the order of the market size.
                We show analytically that when market impact is included, risk exposure has to be appropriately increased by including a term which which describes how far the investor is from the asymptotic classic equilibrium.  We further test numerically the validity of our analytical result.</it><br>            <a href="" target="_blank">Go to paper</a></p>

        <h2>Multi-scaling of wholesale electricity prices</h2>

        <p>
        
        We empirically analyze the most volatile component of the electricity price time series from two North-American wholesale electricity markets. We show that these time series exhibit fluctuations which are not described by a Brownian Motion, as they show multi-scaling, high Hurst exponents and sharp price movements. We use the generalized Hurst exponent (GHE, H(q)) to show that although these time-series have strong cyclical components, the fluctuations exhibit persistent behaviour, i.e., H(q)>0.5. We investigate the effectiveness of the GHE as a predictive tool in a simple linear forecasting model, and study the forecast error as a function of H(q), with q=1 and q=2. Our results suggest that the GHE can be used as prediction tool for these time series when the Hurst exponent is dynamically evaluated on rolling time windows of size ≈50−100 hours. These results are also compared to the case in which the cyclical components have been subtracted from the time series, showing the importance of cyclicality in the prediction power of the Hurst exponent.</it><br>

        <h2>Neurogenesis paradoxically decreases both pattern separation and memory interference</h2>
        <p>Finnegan, Becker</p>
        <p>
        
        The hippocampus has been the focus of memory research for decades. While the functional role of this structure is not fully understood, it is widely recognized as being vital for rapid yet accurate encoding and retrieval of associative memories. Since the discovery of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus by Altman and Das in the 1960's, many theories and models have been put forward to explain the functional role it plays in learning and memory. These models postulate different ways in which new neurons are introduced into the dentate gyrus and their functional importance for learning and memory. Few if any previous models have incorporated the unique properties of young adult-born dentate granule cells and the developmental trajectory. In this paper, we propose a novel computational model of the dentate gyrus that incorporates the developmental trajectory of the adult-born dentate granule cells, including changes in synaptic plasticity, connectivity, excitability and lateral inhibition, using a modified version of the Restricted Boltzmann machine. Our results show superior performance on memory reconstruction tasks for both recent and distally learned items, when the unique characteristics of young dentate granule cells are taken into account. Even though the hyperexcitability of the young neurons generates more overlapping neural codes, reducing pattern separation, the unique properties of the young neurons nonetheless contribute to reducing retroactive and proactive interference, at both short and long time scales. The sparse connectivity is particularly important for generating distinct memory traces for highly overlapping patterns that are learned within the same context.</it><br>

        <h2>Bounds on transient instability for complex ecosystems</h2>
        <p>Caravelli, Staniczenko</p>
        <p>
        Stability is a desirable property of complex ecosystems. If a community of interacting species is
        at a stable equilibrium point then it is able to withstand small perturbations without any adverse
        effect. In ecology, the Jacobian matrix evalufated at an equilibrium point is known as the community
        matrix, which represents the population dynamics of interacting species. The system’s asymptotic
        short- and long-term behaviour can be determined from eigenvalues derived from the community
        matrix. Here we use results from the theory of pseudospectra to describe intermediate, transient
        dynamics. We show that the transition from stable to unstable dynamics includes a region of
        transient instability, where the effect of a small perturbation is amplified before ultimately decaying.
        The shift from stability to transient instability depends on the magnitude of a perturbation, and we
        show how to determine lower and upper bounds to the maximum amplitude of perturbations. Of
        five different types of community matrix, we find that amplification is least severe with predatorprey
        interactions. This analysis is relevant to other systems whose dynamics can be expressed in
        terms of the Jacobian matrix. Through understanding transient instability, we can learn under what
        conditions multiple perturbations—multiple external shocks—will irrecoverably break stability.

        <h2>Geometric phases and cyclic isotropic cosmologies</h2>
        <p>Banchi, Caravelli</p>
        <p>
        In the present paper we study the evolution of the modes of a scalar field in a cyclic cosmology.
        In order to keep the discussion clear, we study the features of a scalar field in a toy model, a
        Friedman-Robertson-Walker universe with a periodic scale factor, in which the universe expands,
        contracts and bounces infinite times, in the approximation in which the dynamic features of this
        universe are driven by some external factor, without the backreaction of the scalar field under study.
        In particular, we show that particle production exhibits features of the cyclic cosmology. Also, by
        studying the Berry phase of the scalar field, we show that contrarily to what is commonly believed,
        the scalar field carries information from one bounce to another in the form of a global phase which
        occurs to be generically non-zero.

        <h2>Ranking nodes according to their path-complexity</h2>
        <p>Caravelli</p>
        <p>
Thermalization is one of the most important phenomena in statistical physics. Often, the transition probabilities between different states in the phase space is or can be approximated by constants. In this case, the system can be described by Markovian transition kernels, and when the phase space is discrete, by Markov chains. In this paper, we introduce a macroscopic entropy on the states of paths of length k and, studying the recursion relation, obtain a fixed point entropy. This analysis leads to a centrality approach to Markov chains entropy.

        <h2>Scale-free networks as an epiphenomenon of memory</h2>
        <p>Caravelli, Hamma, Di Ventra</p>
        <p>
        Many realistic networks are scale-free, with small characteristic path lengths, high
        clustering, and power law in their degree distribution. They can be obtained by dynamical networks
        in which a preferential attachment process takes place. However, this mechanism is nonlocal,
        in the sense that it requires knowledge of the whole graph in order for the graph to be
        updated. Instead, if preferential attachment and realistic networks occur in physical systems,
        these features need to emerge from a local model. In this paper, we propose a local model and
        show that a possible ingredient (which is often underrated) for obtaining scale-free networks with
        local rules is memory. Such a model can be realised in solid-state circuits, using non-linear passive
        elements with memory such as memristors, and thus can be tested experimentally.

        <h2>Higher-order interference and single-system postulates characterizing quantum theory</h2>
        <p>Barnum, Mueller, Ududec</p>
        <p>
        We present a new characterization of quantum theory in terms of simple physical principles
        that is different from previous ones in two important respects: first, it only refers to properties
        of single systems without any assumptions on the composition of many systems; and second, it
        is closer to experiment by having absence of higher-order interference as a postulate, which is
        currently the subject of experimental investigation. We give three postulates – no higher-order
        interference, classical decomposability of states, and strong symmetry – and prove that the only
        non-classical operational probabilistic theories satisfying them are real, complex, and quaternionic
        quantum theory, together with 3-level octonionic quantum theory and ball state spaces of arbitrary
        dimension. Then we show that adding observability of energy as a fourth postulate yields complex
        quantum theory as the unique solution, relating the emergence of the complex numbers to the
        possibility of Hamiltonian dynamics. We also show that there may be interesting non-quantum
        theories satisfying only the first two of our postulates, which would allow for higher-order interference
        in experiments while still respecting the contextuality analogue of the local orthogonality principle.
